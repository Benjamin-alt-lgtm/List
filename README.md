**Playlist & Desk Management - Python Practice**

**Project Description**
This simple Python project demonstrates basic operations with lists, user input, and data manipulation. It is divided into two parts:

**Playlist Manager:** Simulates how a user might manage a playlist of songs.

**Student Desk List:** Collects student names from user input and allows basic editing of the list.

Both parts are excellent beginner-level examples for practicing Python fundamentals.

**Features**
**Playlist Manager:**
1. Creates a list of songs.
2. Modifies existing items in the list.
3. Adds new songs to the end or beginning of the playlist.
4. Prints the playlist after each update.

**Student Desk List:**
1. Accepts names of three students via user input.
2. Stores the names in a list.
3. Allows the user to replace one student's name.
4. Allows the user to insert a new name at a specific position.
5. Displays the updated list after each change.

**What You’ll Learn**
This project is useful for learning:
1. How to define and modify Python lists.
2. Indexing and slicing of lists.
3. Using .append() and .insert() methods.
4. Working with input() for user interaction.
5. Basic list manipulation techniques.

**Future Improvements**
Here are a few suggestions to take this project to the next level:
✅ Add a menu system to allow multiple operations (add, remove, replace) through user selection.
🔁 Use loops so the user can enter more than three names or continue until they choose to stop.
🧹 Implement input validation to prevent blank or invalid entries.
📋 Add functionality to delete names or sort the list alphabetically.
💾 Store the final playlist and student desk list in a text file or JSON.
🖥️ Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt for better interaction.
